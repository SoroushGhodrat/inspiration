## Color Combinations Section

The `ColorCombinations` component is designed to showcase various color combinations for text and background used in the project. This component helps in visualizing how different color pairs look together, ensuring that the chosen colors provide good contrast and are visually appealing.

### Why Use Correct Color Combinations?

Using the correct color combinations for text and background is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Readability:** Proper contrast between text and background colors ensures that the text is easily readable. Poor contrast can strain the eyes and make it difficult for users to read the content.

2. **Accessibility:** Ensuring good color contrast is essential for accessibility. Users with visual impairments, such as color blindness, rely on high contrast to distinguish between text and background. Adhering to accessibility guidelines helps make your content accessible to a broader audience.

3. **Aesthetics:** Good color combinations enhance the overall aesthetics of your application. They contribute to a visually pleasing design, which can improve user experience and engagement.

4. **Branding:** Consistent and thoughtful use of color combinations can reinforce your brand identity. It helps in creating a cohesive look and feel across your application.
